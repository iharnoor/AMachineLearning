"So excited to get these awesome earphones! Amazing sound quality. The product quality is also great, wires are of great material and not thin. Fits perfectly in the ears. Just love this product. The package contains a pair of earphones, charging cable, extra sets of earplugs (Small and Large sizes, as the Medium size is already fir into the earphones) and a small portable pouch for carrying your earphones.",5,,
Thank you Bose. The best wireless earbuds I've own. High quality you can tell a lot of thought has been put into this product. It's worth every penny. Highly recommend Bose SoundSport Wireless.,5,,
"I purchased these for my son, originally he used them daily and loved them, used them around the house as well as when he was mowing as the sound was great quality and he could hear his music. Over the last year the battery life has gone down to less than 1 hour of use time and they don't re charge well at all. Now they barely hold a charge for the 45 minutes he mows. For the hefty price I paid for these they should last longer than 18 months. I would not recommend.",1,,
"These headphones provide a firm fit and will not fall out, and the sound is high quality. Regarding product quality, these are very poor.

Like most reviews state, these headphones are plagued with battery issues, and begin to fall apart fairly quickly. They are also prone to volume imbalances between the sides. I?ve owned two pairs with the same experience on each. On the second pair I had hoped Bose had fixed the issues, since it was a year later. They had not.

It?s unfortunate, because although Bose has always had more expensive products, it was a safe bet you would get your money?s worth. That is not the case for these.",1,,
"I purchased this for my gf June 2018. It started having battery issues in August 2019 which is after the 1-year warranty expires.

The generation after this is completely wireless and has numerous reports of connection issues, so I went with this model.

I recommend buying something else.",1,,
"These do not stay in your ears, I don?t think they would fit any human ear, I ended up returning",1,,
"This product started it ""Great""! Nice sounds, nice battery time, nice volume. To months ago it's volume was getting lower and lower. Now I'm at the point where I can barely hear it over noises at work. I've treated this pair like it was a baby cause the price was on the more expensive side for earbuds. Bose is awesome for home stereo equipment, but lacks long term quality for these earbuds. For the price I could have bought my old Jaybirds twice which lasted a year before they broke. Don't splurge on this item unless you can afford new ones every 3 months.",1,,
"I am very disappointed in this purchase.

My left earbud has gone completely silent, despite treating with care and purchasing my pair less than two weeks ago. The sound quality is decent but not worth the price. The buds are very large - you will not forget that you?re wearing them. The maximum battery does not even last one work day.",1,,
"It came last night in a bag and didn't think anything of it. Turned it on and the headphones were trying to connect to, ""Sean's Phone"" I thought sure ok I can fix that took it out of my ear and took out the buds and IT HAD SOMEONE ELSES EAR WAX CAKED ON AND, AND, AND EAR HAIRS!!! I washed my ears three times last night. That is unacceptable!!! THE PRODUCT I BOUGHT WAS SOILED!!! Shame!",1,,
"I just used it about 6 months, The rubber of the cable near the base of the earphone was broken.",1,,
This is my second pair and these only lasted 9 months and the first pair only lasted 6 months. Not worth it!,1,,
"Pairing:
Pairing was great. I used them with an Android Pixel XL and no problem. Plus you can also use NFC to pair them which is a great plus.
This said, I downloaded the app and it was useless as I could not initially pair my headphones to it – it kept telling me to put them in pairing mode, which I would, but it still would not pair. I use these w/o the mobile app.

Sound:
Sound was EASILY the best of the bunch – I tried 5 headsets (see other reviews). The bass is deep. Maybe this is possible because they are so huge in your ear!

Fit:
Fit excellent once on the ear – also the best of all I tried. Super fast and easy to put in and out and I love the clip on the back to ensure you don’t loose them. I lost my last set (Epic 2s) because although they were wrapped over my neck, I forgot about them and they fell off. Use the clip!

These are HUGE buds though. Silly Huge. But the trade off is the great sound i guess.

Call Quality:
I know its not their primary function but call quality (on receiver end) was terrible. It seems there is no mic function at all I have to hold the phone up to my face, which defeats the purpose of hands free.

Overall, of all the sets I tried, these were the ones I picked. As a bonus I got a cyber Monday deal and got them for $99!

My only complaint (other than call quality) is I wish they were slightly smaller, and the battery lasted longer. It seems to drain much faster than all the others I tried.

I have also tried Apple Airpods, Bose Soundsport, Epic 2 BT, and the LG HBS730, and Jaba Elite. See other reviews, but the bose were my final choice with the Epic a close second.",5,,
"These replaced my wired Bose in-ear buds. I've been a Bose fan for many years and own over the ear QC2's, MIE2's, a sound bar and other Bose devices that I enjoy. I like the sound of the wired MIE2 but I wanted to cut the cord for more freedom while wearing my ear buds. These do exactly what I had hoped. The ""stay hear+"" tips are a definite improvement over the older version. I insert them into my ear and twist the bud gently rearward to provide a solid hold. These buds are NOT noise cancelling but the design of the tips keeps out quite a bit more noise than the older design. Pairing to my MacBook, iPad, iPhone and smart tv was simple. The best part is the sound. Both voice and music are pleasantly balanced across the frequency range. I had a cheap pair of wireless I bought last year (<$30) and the sound on those is like listening through a tin can. I did like the freedom of wireless though. What a difference the SoundSports are. Many have noted the size of the bud being large. It is a bit big but that really doesn't detract from the design or comfort. My only concern would be the interference you might get trying to wear them inside a bike or cycle helmet. Haven't tried that yet. The on/off and pairing control mounted on the right bud is easy to find but maybe a bit ""mushy"" to the touch. The inline control for volume and phone response is easily accessible and intuitive but also a bit soft. Not a serious issue by any means but be aware. The alligator clip to secure the headphones to your shirt is an improvement over the old style but still can pull off the cord fairly easily. Despite these few minor flaws I give these Bose SoundSport headphones a full five star rating. You won't be disappointed.",5,,
"I just got these in yesterday so I can’t write a great review YET.
First, I can’t believe I spent $200 on a pair of headphones but I do use my headphones a LOT so I was able to justify the splurge.
This is the first pair of “high end” headphones that I’ve bought so my experience is limited. I’m comparing mostly to LG HBS850.
The first thing I noticed was how big the ear pieces are. They are pretty large and protrude out of your ears quite a bit. The LG ear piece is tiny in comparison(see image). I thought there would be no way the things were staying in my ears, however, they are MUCH more comfortable than the LG ear pieces. I didn’t even realize how uncomfortable the LGs were. The Bose ear piece doesn’t actually go inside your ear canal like the LG does. With this type of earpiece, the Bose is not quite noise canceling(nor is it supposed to be).
Some of the reviews say the Bose don’t get loud enough. Since they don’t actually go inside the ear canal and create a seal like the LGs and other internal earbuds do, it does seem like they don’t get quite as loud, however, they do get plenty loud. They just don’t get so loud that it hurts. If you want that, youu probably should go with the Beats.
They connected to my iPhone 7 effortlessly. A mere click( we’ll more of a mushy push) of the power button and voila there it was on my phone.
Then came the sound test. Oh my goodness!! They sound amazing. I can’t believe the difference in the sound quality between these and the LGs.
It’s like the difference in monaural and stereophonic sound. The bass is very strong. I’m no techy person so I can’t really go into detail about how great the sound is but it is amazing.
So that’s about all I can say for now. I will update more about the quality after I’ve used them for a while.",5,,
"First off let me give you an idea on how often I use these. Everyday for at least 3 to 6 hours. So I’m constantly pressing the pause/play button. That being said, This is now my second pair of these headphones. I only have two qualms; first the rubber around the volume/next button wears out and there’s no way to fix it (I tried crazy glue). Second, the actual Bluetooth range is maybe 10 ft. I have a very small house, only 900sqft, And placing the phone in the center of the house didn’t work either. Even with those two qualms I can’t give these a bad review because I love these wireless headphone. Bose has always delivered exceptional sound quality! If you like them as much as me buying a second or third pair doesn’t seem so bad. Bose has spoiled me so the $20 version of these won’t do!",5,,
"I've only had them for two days, but I'm really happy I got them. Read all the reviews of these and others, weighed the pros and cons. I was on the fence, knowing the sound quality of my old wired version and if I wanted to upgrade. But it comes down to this for those that had the wired sound sports before, of all headphones I've had, shure, etymonics, the Bose are the most comfortable. They are not sound isolating, but they are fantastic for runs and long wear time. That considered, and any difference in sound, these are so comfortable and the perfect step from my prior wired versions. Might get the sound true for when I need quiet, but these are great and and fantastic (maybe not a good as my old shure's).",5,,
"1/15/18 UPDATE: I have been keeping a record of my use of these ear buds and am amazed. I am finding that the battery is lasting for close to 10 hours....... I currently have used 8 hours and still have 20 % off of a full charge. These are the best earbuds on the market. I not only use them to listen to my music, but when I can't sleep I listen to the TV with them thru my phone. Really fantastic.... and so easily paired with devices. GET THEM THEY WILL BE THE LAST ONES YOU EVER NEED TO BUY......

The best ear buds I have ever had. I have very small ears and I have a very hard time finding ones that stay in my ears and no not hurt them after a time of usage. I thought I would try these because I am a Bose person. They are FANTASTIC.... very very comfortable and no matter what I do they do not come out of my ears. I wore them for 6 hours straight and never even felt them in. The sound is Bose quality. Not like my Noise cancelling new ones, but extremely close to the sound quality (-) the noise cancellation.
The small fit perfect in my tiny ears
Even shaking my head.",5,,
"I've used Bose wire ear buds for years and love them. Very comfortable and great sound.
But like everything else, if you use them a lot, they will wear out some how.
I recently ""inherited"" my daughters iPhone 7 Plus and needed a wireless solution. After researching ear buds, I settled on Jabra 65t's.
They were nice, sounded good and had the features I wanted. Unfortunately, I could not keep them from falling out, even after trying to use foam ear tips. I sent the Jabras back.
I didn't want the Frankenstein Bose wireless buds, so settled on these, even though they are wired together.
These fit similarly to the wired Bose that I have and do not fall out!
Sound is great and longevity will tell with time.
I will update this review if things change.",5,,
"If you are looking for a wireless headphone to use while you work out or running, stop searching further. This is it. Just for context, I own a Bose QC 35 II, a Beats 3 and a couple of other in-ear head phones. While the larger over ear headphones like the QC35 and the Beats 3 provide excellent sound quality and noise cancellation, if feel like they are big to wear, specially while working out. Some times they slide of your head while doing a bench press. The Beats is my least favorite because of the pressure it creates on my skin. When using other in hear headphones, I can still hear outside noise and the overall sound quality is average. The Bose SoundSport stands heads and shoulder above any in-ear headphones I've used in terms of audio quality. Even though noise cancellation is not a product feature, because of how these headphone sit inside your ear, they effectively block out all outside noise. They are very comfortable to wear - they come with 3 adapters that you can choose from to suit the size of you ear opening. So, it is not a one size fits all scenario. The sweat absorption is superb and it stays securely fit at all times. The charging levels last me for at least 3 gym sessions of 2 hour each and I still have some left for a weekend run. So, very practical as well. I absolutely love this headphone and is my preferred one to use when it comes to working out.",5,,
"These have worked fabulously - these are however my second pair - my first pair mysteriously stopped working. A quick phone call to Bose was all it took and they said send it back and we'll send you a new pair. Very easy. Amazing customer service and I was very glad to have these back again. They work at long range. I will often use them with my phone in one place while I run on a track, they continue working even when I'm pretty far from my phone. It's incredible. I also will put them on when my phone is in my running belt and run outside. It is great that the noise cancellation is intentionally - by design not complete noise cancellation so that you may still hear cars and what's happening around you. Awesome for listening to books, podcasts or music while running. Easy to charge, love the charging case you can get for these too. Bose is an outstanding company that makes outstanding products.",5,,
"Great ear buds. Use them daily as a professional truck driver and my truck has no audio unit. The sound is awesome, battery life is excellent, but the mic is terrible is the reason for three stars. To respond to text messages while driving I always would use apple voice dictation but when I started using these earbuds the interpretations of what I was speaking were not even close. Blaming apple I just dealt with it until one day I forgot my Bose buds at home and was forced to work that day with the factory apple ear buds. Voice dictation was dead on and the person on the other side of phone calls I made that day said I was way easier to understand and hear. These would be a perfect product if the voice mic worked as well as the free apple buds’ mic does.... oh well the apple buds hurt my ears after having them in for a few hours. The bose I can have in all day and I don’t even feel them. They will never fall out even with strenious activity. If music is your priority, these are excellent.... for the price I wish all the functions worked equally well though. Gift card purchase otherwise I would have gotten something less expensive. They will kill your phones battery almost twice as fast is something else to keep in mind.
Update: Had an issue with the volume fading overtime (this is 12 hour per day use 5 days a week) and after I found out my amazon return time limit was up and I contactsd Bose customer support. What did they do? They not only sent me a new set but said keep all the accessories and only return the buds. Classy move for sure. The new ones almost sound better with a higher volume but maybe its just me using crappy buds for a week. I figure its whatever with the mic problems because who gets these to talk. They won’t fall out of your ears during strenuous activity and sound great. Cant go wrong.",5,,
So my last pair of headphones were the Beats 2. They fit well and the sound was ok but they broke three times. The ear bud snapped off from the housing. They refused to fix the third time so I went to Bose since I always had good over the hear headphones from them. Have not been disappointed. Sound is much better than beats. The charging case is perfect for traveling. The app always informs on battery level and takes heart rate if you are into using them for working out. They fit great in ear and dont fall out. Batter last about three hours longer than Beats. Totally recommend.,5,,
My review is going to be brief for now but this was one of the best audio-related purchases I've made in recent years. I was having a hard time deciding between the Jaybird X3s and the Bose SoundSports but I'm glad I went with the SoundSports instead. The battery life on the X3s is one hour better than the SoundSports however ability to charge the SoundSports with any micro-USB cable is a huge plus. I don't have to worry about remembering to bring an adapter everywhere I go,5,,
"I was looking for Bluetooth earbuds to use with my new iPhone (that doesn't have a headphone jack), and considered several options that are less expensive and all have great reviews. However, I have had two pairs of wired Bose earbuds in the past and they always have GREAT sound and have lasted a LONG time. I had to go with my instinct and pay more for a pair of Bose again, and I'm not disappointed. The other brands would have probably been fine, but Bose has the best sound and quality, and that does cost a little bit more! These are comfortable, don't fall out of my ears, the sound is outstanding both for my music and phone calls (as well as for the people on the other end of the call). People usually don't even realize that I'm using headphones! My recommendation...spend a little bit more on your earbuds! These are worth the investment, and you won't need to replace the cheaper ones in six months.",5,,
"I have had half a dozen of these and give 5 stars.

Negatives:

my dogs like to eat them. Must be the perfect hardness of plastic for dogs to chew. That’s why I’ve purchased a few. Can’t really ding Bose for that.

Wire around back of neck isn’t great because the wire tends to stick a little to my neck skin and pull on them. The clip that comes with them helps but you’ve got to be careful not to lose it. Simple solution is that I drape them in the front.

Positives:

I gave battery life 5 stars because they last as long as advertised and the charge back up very quickly.

Comfort- I’m a huge fan of bose’s silicone ear brace because it keeps them in place without having to jam them in my ear. My favorite feature. The bigger over ear or on ear sets make my ears hot. These don’t.

Sound quality is great for an ear bud. Typical nose sound. Punchy bass, good treble. And I find they are loud enough to work on an airplane without noise cancelling.",5,,
"Purchased these prior to running the 48 mile RunDisney “Dopey Challenge” series in Florida and have zero complaints. Great sound, awesome battery life, loud enough to enjoy music without blocking out ambient/traffic noise. Lightweight, easy to pair, stayed connected with no issues. The heart rate monitor worked flawlessly with RunKeeper with no additional setup (I didn’t even know this was an included feature, so it was a pleasant surprise!)

I’ve been running events since 2013 and have tried most of the big brands; yurbuds have been my go-to for most of this time. Have tried a few different Bluetooth headsets and have been consistently disappointed with battery life, sound quality, and connectivity issues. This pair exhibits none of these problems.

First impressions: these sound *great*! Not quite as good as my wired Bose in-ear phones (as one would expect), but vastly superior to the muddy response of the Yurbuds models. Crisp highs, mellow mid, and rich bass. Awesome.

No complaints about battery life, they still had plenty of juice left after I finished my full marathon.

I have seen some complaints regarding ruggedness of the control buttons; I tend not to mess with these things while I’m running, but they seem to be standing up to my occasional poking without issue.",5,,
"Needless to say the sound is just perfect. this is my 4th pair of earbuds from BOSE. I purchased this item on March 24, 2017, 40 days ago, and the earpiece started to fell apart. I am treating the headphone like a jewel (because BOSE craft jewels), I am not taking it to any gym or outdoors, just in my office or inside my home. I am kind of worry now with this purchase and I don't know how to get this resolved.",1,,
"Purchased these less than a year ago when they were on sale for $99 instead of a $149. I love Bose products and have always been very pleased with them. Except today the rubber that encases the buttons started coming off as my picture shows. This obviously isn’t good as now dust and dirt will start to get inside and eventually cause them not to work. I attempted to get an exchange done through amazon (yes I know it’s been about 10 months since my purchase) BUT I wasn’t asking for a refund I was asking for an exchange and figured a trillion dollar company could work with their customers, especially one who spends thousands of dollars a year with them, well I thought wrong. The first customer service representative gave me hope saying to send them pictures and that they would escalate the issue and provided me a phone number to call. That number of course was an invalid phone number. So I contacted them again and the new representative said there was nothing they could do. At that point I asked to speak with a manager and got the run around again saying there was nothing they could do. They attempted to still try and provide me with the same number the first representative did which is an invalid phone number. I told them that multiple times yet they still tried to provide me a bogus number and said sorry there’s nothing they can do. I’m hoping the manufacturer will see this review and contact me but honestly not getting my hopes up",1,,
"For those - like myself - who are now looking to buy a premium pair of sports in-ears, don't waste your time on these. Bose should be absolutely ashamed that they dare offer a product like this at all. For roughly $160 including NYC taxes you get a pair of totally mediocre headphones that fall apart the second you unbox them. It's actually shocking how poorly constructed these are... See the photos, all the controls are literally falling apart! And no, I don't abuse them at all by any standards. I do blame myself for waiting too long to go back to the Bose store at Columbus Circle where I bought them, because of course, by the time they got to being useless (I can't switch them on anymore, the power button has literally fallen off!!), I'm a few weeks over my 1-year warranty period. A total sham. And that includes the store, which is operated by people who really couldn't care less. I read the EU has a 2-year warranty period, are they made up to higher standards there?! Bose: a sad excuse for a premium brand imho",1,,
"Update: After 18 months of owning these, they no longer charge above 50%- leading me to losing battery after about 1.5hours of use. I am EXTREMELY disappointed with these- not only are they costly, but they have poor sound, terrible bass, clarity is terrible, taking calls is tricky and they just don't last. I wish I could trade them in or return them to Bose but I'm past my window. I might have gotten 50 hours of overall usage out of these. They just sit in a drawer now and I use my Apple Airpods for everything. Stay away- do not buy this product.",1,,
"I am updating this review... all I have said below is true..but...now the headphones no longer hold a charge. I have had them less than a year and have tried new firmware and other online recommendations and none of those worked for me. And so, not sure if I will buy bose again...I might... try the new version of these and hope...as I really did love the sound.. but man..they should last longer that 11 months.

I have been looking for headphones that I can wear working out that still sound good, and are comfortable for taking walks, yard work, etc... and these are it. To me the sound is very very good. Most headphones like these...(to my ears..and we are all different...) have a solid midrange and bass which I just could not find in other sports type headphones. Having said that...these were also substantially more expensive than other headphones I have bought in the past...Koss KSC75 --over ear with surprising good sound for the price!!, but not the deep bass like the Bose, AfterShokz Trekz Titanium Open Ear Wireless Bone Conduction Headphones---no real bass to speak of...but cool idea, gave them to my wife, 1MORE Triple Driver In-Ear Headphones--pretty good sound, again, to that rich sound like the bose, and not comfortable for my ears, 66 Audio BTS+....pretty nice actually, but poor Bluetooth strength and battery life...and again...didn't sound as good as the bose.",1,,
"I have been using the SoundSport for 10 months on and off now and they are already falling appart. I would say that the use I have put on these unit has been low, and the rubber on both the right and left ear bud is already detaching from the harder plactic peice. Also, the rubber covering the control has separated from the body of the control. The buttons were always a little spongy, but now the volume down button is almost unusable with out moving the rubber cover into just the right alignment with both hands. the sound quality on the unit is great but I'm very disappointed with the material qulity. For the price I paid for the unit I expect a lot more when it comes to a product made by bose.",1,,
"Not a great product from Bose. I purchased 6 months ago and the headphones are already falling apart. As you can see by my picture the rubber on the volume control is falling out and the rubber around the headphone and power button is falling off. Those are just the visible issues. The headphones also do not hold a charge for 6 hours of music playing as marketed. They last one or two hours before telling me to plug them in. When I do they charge for 5 min and say they are fully charged, just to repeat the cycle. As far as performance goes the sound quality is good but they are not very loud. When not in use I always kept the headphones in their case in my backpack. I wasn’t looking for the loudest headphones, just a pair that lasts and that I can hear over my footsteps and breathing while running. Regrettably Overall this produxt failed to deliver. Not worth the price. I’ll use these until I can’t any more, then it’s time to find a new product.",1,,
"I agonized over this purchase for six months. I looked at reviews, I watched videos, I read tech specs, and did shot after shot of tequila crying into the night begging God to help me! Okay the first three are true. They arrived in one day in a really nice package. I have worn them on several bike rides and gym visits. I sweat like a whore in church and they stand up to the punishment. They have never fallen out. Even when I'm in full Rob Zombie metal thrash mode. I try to make them fall out and they will not.

The app is nice and works perfectly. Also, I use Runkeeper and now I get heart rate data in that app. The sound is amazing just like all Bose products.

I have Bose noise canceling headphones, a mini wireless speaker, and a Bose system in my car.",5,,
"I must admit there have been many head-phones before this, but from this day forth, Bose is all I'll wear, no matter what the cost, the comfort, the exact size, as if tailored to my ears during my runs. If I were being asked, if I trust Bose for my entertainment & sporting good needs, I'd answer ""Yes"" without question. The sound quality and the range has never been achieved by any other head-phones I've worn to date. Thanks for your time in this matter.
Fraz Northern Virginia",5,,
I actually lost the first pair. but replaced them with the same thing because of how well they work. I would not buy anything else because the price is right! Great sound and fit so well. Comes with three different size ear pieces for comfort!!,5,,
I?ve had the same pair but in black & red. I love these headphones & will continue to buy them. They do last and are sweat resistant as well& I sweat a lot a lot. I?ve had my other ones who recently gave out for 2 years. One of the best headphones I?ve ever owned!,5,,
"Amazing headphones. Bought this for my wife and she loves it. The only complaint I have against this one is the battery. While my Samsung ear buds work for almost an entire day and I can charge them in their charging case, allowing me to almost always be able to use it. Everyday. But my wife cannot use this headphone for more than a day and if she forgets to charge them she cannot use them that day.",5,,
"I splurged on these due to my love of another Bose pair I got because of the silicone ear tips. Nothing is more comfortable than these earbuds. I have worn these 8-10 hours straight with no pain or discomfort and the sound quality is amazing, such good bass. Great battery life too!",5,,
"I saw some bad reviews after buying and got worried but so far so good for me. The only downside so far is the bulky size of these. They stick out significantly. Reviewers have reported longevity issues so if you intend on using these excessively, might wanna reconsider.",5,,
Gifted this for my husband over a year ago and he uses this regularly for his runs. Great quality and sound. I have even borrowed this a time or two for my 5k's and have been impressed with how lightweight they are and yet stay in place without moving during my runs. They stay in your ear nicely. The small clip to attach them to your shirt collar can come off the cord and we have lost ours. We have since bought third-part clip replacements that have worked fine with this.,5,,
i had bought skullcandy bluetooth earbuds twice at $50 each and they broke couple months after. ugh! soo i decided to go higher $ and try the Bose sound sport ... yep its worth the $130! These go everywhere with me now and are a must have if you want high quality and clear crisp sound! The case is really nice to have and protects the earbuds in my purse. Although these are not noise cancelling they do a great job of damping ambient noise.,5,,
"Super impressed with these wireless headphones. I was skeptical as I have the Bose wired headphones and I love them, I thought that the sound quality would not be on par.....I was wrong. Great sound quality and it makes going to the gym so much better now that I do not have to deal with cords and with anything in my pocket. I highly recommend these headphones. They are also super comfortable.",5,,
"I received these for a Xmass present and they are truly the best I've used the price I've paid for inferior headphones have been double the cost of these and the customer service with Bose is top notch I had a problem with the rubber on the mic and wanted to get them repaired, Bose does not repair they replace the process was so painless just be sure to register your product on their website or in the Bose Connect app their customer service definitely gets 10 out of 5 stars",5,,
"I have had a pair of launch day SoundSports that finally started falling apart (rubber coming off around the earbuds) to the point it was getting on my nerves while running. The sound quality was still very good, they were just falling apart!

I replaced them with a new set and I very happy!

I do wish someone from Bose would have emailed me back and about repair/replacement options.",5,,
"I love Bose headphones.
Decided to cut the cord and go Bluetooth.
Great bose sound, but only get about 6 hours before I need to charge.
Would recommend.",5,,
This was a gift ; it works well and he loves it. The only complaint was the length of time it stays charged. He used it 10 hrs at a time and it needs charging at 5hrs. Otherwise it is an awesome purchase.,5,,
"I bought these for my husband last Christmas and he adored them! He almost always has headphones in his ears listening to podcasts, sports talk and music (including at night) and these are the best sounding, longest lasting, most comfortable wireless buds he's ever used. Unfortunately he accidentally put them through the wash in the pocket of a hoody several months ago and has been in mourning ever since. I ordered another pair for him for Christmas this year and he is thrilled once again! Bose really has done a wonderful job packing such great sound and comfort into such a small, wireless package! I can't recommend enough!",5,,
"Great sound from such small speakers, they also provide some noise canceling due to the way the fit in your ear which is a plus. The materials and build quality is better then the beats. They last a long time on a single charge and are perfect for to make phone calls on. I do own the QC 35 and I have to say these headphones are really good.",5,,
