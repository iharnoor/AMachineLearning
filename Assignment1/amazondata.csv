"I agonized over this purchase for six months. I looked at reviews, I watched videos, I read tech specs, and did shot after shot of tequila crying into the night begging God to help me! Okay the first three are true. They arrived in one day in a really nice package. I have worn them on several bike rides and gym visits. I sweat like a whore in church and they stand up to the punishment. They have never fallen out. Even when I'm in full Rob Zombie metal thrash mode. I try to make them fall out and they will not.

The app is nice and works perfectly. Also, I use Runkeeper and now I get heart rate data in that app. The sound is amazing just like all Bose products.

I have Bose noise canceling headphones, a mini wireless speaker, and a Bose system in my car.",5,1
"I must admit there have been many head-phones before this, but from this day forth, Bose is all I'll wear, no matter what the cost, the comfort, the exact size, as if tailored to my ears during my runs. If I were being asked, if I trust Bose for my entertainment & sporting good needs, I'd answer ""Yes"" without question. The sound quality and the range has never been achieved by any other head-phones I've worn to date. Thanks for your time in this matter.

I actually lost the first pair. but replaced them with the same thing because of how well they work. I would not buy anything else because the price is right! Great sound and fit so well. Comes with three different size ear pieces for comfort!!,5,1
I?ve had the same pair but in black & red. I love these headphones & will continue to buy them. They do last and are sweat resistant as well& I sweat a lot a lot. I?ve had my other ones who recently gave out for 2 years. One of the best headphones I?ve ever owned!,5,1
"Amazing headphones. Bought this for my wife and she loves it. The only complaint I have against this one is the battery. While my Samsung ear buds work for almost an entire day and I can charge them in their charging case, allowing me to almost always be able to use it. Everyday. But my wife cannot use this headphone for more than a day and if she forgets to charge them she cannot use them that day.",5,1
"I splurged on these due to my love of another Bose pair I got because of the silicone ear tips. Nothing is more comfortable than these earbuds. I have worn these 8-10 hours straight with no pain or discomfort and the sound quality is amazing, such good bass. Great battery life too!",5,1
"I saw some bad reviews after buying and got worried but so far so good for me. The only downside so far is the bulky size of these. They stick out significantly. Reviewers have reported longevity issues so if you intend on using these excessively, might wanna reconsider.",5,1
Gifted this for my husband over a year ago and he uses this regularly for his runs. Great quality and sound. I have even borrowed this a time or two for my 5k's and have been impressed with how lightweight they are and yet stay in place without moving during my runs. They stay in your ear nicely. The small clip to attach them to your shirt collar can come off the cord and we have lost ours. We have since bought third-part clip replacements that have worked fine with this.,5,1
i had bought skullcandy bluetooth earbuds twice at $50 each and they broke couple months after. ugh! soo i decided to go higher $ and try the Bose sound sport ... yep its worth the $130! These go everywhere with me now and are a must have if you want high quality and clear crisp sound! The case is really nice to have and protects the earbuds in my purse. Although these are not noise cancelling they do a great job of damping ambient noise.,5,1
"Super impressed with these wireless headphones. I was skeptical as I have the Bose wired headphones and I love them, I thought that the sound quality would not be on par.....I was wrong. Great sound quality and it makes going to the gym so much better now that I do not have to deal with cords and with anything in my pocket. I highly recommend these headphones. They are also super comfortable.",5,1
"I received these for a Xmass present and they are truly the best I've used the price I've paid for inferior headphones have been double the cost of these and the customer service with Bose is top notch I had a problem with the rubber on the mic and wanted to get them repaired, Bose does not repair they replace the process was so painless just be sure to register your product on their website or in the Bose Connect app their customer service definitely gets 10 out of 5 stars",5,1
"I have had a pair of launch day SoundSports that finally started falling apart (rubber coming off around the earbuds) to the point it was getting on my nerves while running. The sound quality was still very good, they were just falling apart!

I replaced them with a new set and I very happy!

I do wish someone from Bose would have emailed me back and about repair/replacement options.",5,1
"I love Bose headphones.
Decided to cut the cord and go Bluetooth.
Great bose sound, but only get about 6 hours before I need to charge.
Would recommend.",5,1
This was a gift ; it works well and he loves it. The only complaint was the length of time it stays charged. He used it 10 hrs at a time and it needs charging at 5hrs. Otherwise it is an awesome purchase.,5,1
"I bought these for my husband last Christmas and he adored them! He almost always has headphones in his ears listening to podcasts, sports talk and music (including at night) and these are the best sounding, longest lasting, most comfortable wireless buds he's ever used. Unfortunately he accidentally put them through the wash in the pocket of a hoody several months ago and has been in mourning ever since. I ordered another pair for him for Christmas this year and he is thrilled once again! Bose really has done a wonderful job packing such great sound and comfort into such a small, wireless package! I can't recommend enough!",5,1
"Great sound from such small speakers, they also provide some noise canceling due to the way the fit in your ear which is a plus. The materials and build quality is better then the beats. They last a long time on a single charge and are perfect for to make phone calls on. I do own the QC 35 and I have to say these headphones are really good.",5,1
"So excited to get these awesome earphones! Amazing sound quality. The product quality is also great, wires are of great material and not thin. Fits perfectly in the ears. Just love this product. The package contains a pair of earphones, charging cable, extra sets of earplugs (Small and Large sizes, as the Medium size is already fir into the earphones) and a small portable pouch for carrying your earphones.",5,1
Thank you Bose. The best wireless earbuds I've own. High quality you can tell a lot of thought has been put into this product. It's worth every penny. Highly recommend Bose SoundSport Wireless.,5,1
"I purchased these for my son, originally he used them daily and loved them, used them around the house as well as when he was mowing as the sound was great quality and he could hear his music. Over the last year the battery life has gone down to less than 1 hour of use time and they don't re charge well at all. Now they barely hold a charge for the 45 minutes he mows. For the hefty price I paid for these they should last longer than 18 months. I would not recommend.",1,0
"These headphones provide a firm fit and will not fall out, and the sound is high quality. Regarding product quality, these are very poor.

Like most reviews state, these headphones are plagued with battery issues, and begin to fall apart fairly quickly. They are also prone to volume imbalances between the sides. I?ve owned two pairs with the same experience on each. On the second pair I had hoped Bose had fixed the issues, since it was a year later. They had not.

It?s unfortunate, because although Bose has always had more expensive products, it was a safe bet you would get your money?s worth. That is not the case for these.",1,0
"I purchased this for my gf June 2018. It started having battery issues in August 2019 which is after the 1-year warranty expires.

The generation after this is completely wireless and has numerous reports of connection issues, so I went with this model.

I recommend buying something else.",1,0
"These do not stay in your ears, I don?t think they would fit any human ear, I ended up returning",1,0
"This product started it ""Great""! Nice sounds, nice battery time, nice volume. To months ago it's volume was getting lower and lower. Now I'm at the point where I can barely hear it over noises at work. I've treated this pair like it was a baby cause the price was on the more expensive side for earbuds. Bose is awesome for home stereo equipment, but lacks long term quality for these earbuds. For the price I could have bought my old Jaybirds twice which lasted a year before they broke. Don't splurge on this item unless you can afford new ones every 3 months.",1,0
"I am very disappointed in this purchase.

My left earbud has gone completely silent, despite treating with care and purchasing my pair less than two weeks ago. The sound quality is decent but not worth the price. The buds are very large - you will not forget that you?re wearing them. The maximum battery does not even last one work day.",1,0
"It came last night in a bag and didn't think anything of it. Turned it on and the headphones were trying to connect to, ""Sean's Phone"" I thought sure ok I can fix that took it out of my ear and took out the buds and IT HAD SOMEONE ELSES EAR WAX CAKED ON AND, AND, AND EAR HAIRS!!! I washed my ears three times last night. That is unacceptable!!! THE PRODUCT I BOUGHT WAS SOILED!!! Shame!",1,0
"I just used it about 6 months, The rubber of the cable near the base of the earphone was broken.",1,0
This is my second pair and these only lasted 9 months and the first pair only lasted 6 months. Not worth it!,1,0
